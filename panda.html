            <h3>PANDA</h3>
                <p>The giant panda has luxuriant black-and-white fur. Adults measure around 1.2 to 1.9 metres (3 feet 11 inches to 6 feet 3 inches) long, including a tail of about 15 cm, and 60 to 90 cm tall at the shoulder. Males can weigh up to 160 kg, Females can weigh as little as 70 kg but can also weigh up to 125 kg. Average adult weight is 100 to 115 kg.Panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold colouring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat.</p><p>Panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa. A 110.45 kg giant panda has a 3D canine teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292. Another study had a 117.5 kg giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons at canine teeth and 1815.9 newtons at carnassial teeth Bones of the left forelimb. The panda's paw has a "thumb" and five fingers; the "thumb" actually a modified sesamoid bone helps it to hold bamboo while eating.</p><p>Pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.</p>
